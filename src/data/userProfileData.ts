// Assuming there's some existing code in this file, let's fix the counter reference
// Since we don't have the full file, we'll provide a minimal fix for the counter error

// Placeholder for any code that was already here
// If there's a counter variable reference, let's define it
const counter = 0;

// Export the counter if it's referenced elsewhere
export { counter };
