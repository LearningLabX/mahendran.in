        "Push notifications help keep users engaged, informed, and active. In this guide, you'll learn how to integrate OneSignal into your Flutter app with custom notification icons and sounds for Android and iOS.",

        "## Step 1: Add the OneSignal Plugin",
        "Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the OneSignal Flutter package:",
        "```yaml\ndependencies:\n  onesignal_flutter: ^3.5.0\n```",
        "Run:",
        "```bash\nflutter pub get\n```",

        "## Step 2: Initialize OneSignal",
        "Create a service file `notification_service.dart`:",
        "```dart\nimport 'package:onesignal_flutter/onesignal_flutter.dart';\n\nclass NotificationService {\n  static Future<void> init() async {\n    OneSignal.shared.setAppId('YOUR-ONESIGNAL-APP-ID');\n\n    // Optional permission prompt for iOS\n    OneSignal.shared.promptUserForPushNotificationPermission();\n\n    // Show notifications when app is in foreground\n    OneSignal.shared.setNotificationWillShowInForegroundHandler((event) {\n      event.complete(event.notification);\n    });\n  }\n}\n```",
        "Call `NotificationService.init();` in your `main()` before `runApp()`:",
        "```dart\nvoid main() async {\n  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();\n  await NotificationService.init();\n  runApp(MyApp());\n}\n```",

        "## Android Setup",
        "1. Create a custom icon `ic_stat_notify.png` and place it in:\n   `android/app/src/main/res/drawable/`",
        "2. Add a custom sound (e.g., `notify_sound.mp3`) to:\n   `android/app/src/main/res/raw/`",
        "3. Edit your `AndroidManifest.xml` inside `<application>`:",
        "```xml\n<meta-data android:name=\"com.onesignal.NotificationIcon\"\n           android:resource=\"@drawable/ic_stat_notify\"/>\n<meta-data android:name=\"com.onesignal.Sound\"\n           android:resource=\"raw/notify_sound\"/>\n```",

        "## iOS Setup",
        "1. Drag your sound file (`notify_sound.wav`) into the `Runner` Xcode project (under Resources).",
        "2. Enable:",
        "   - Push Notifications",
        "   - Background Modes > Remote notifications",
        "3. Update `Info.plist` with:",
        "```xml\n<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>\n<array>\n  <string>remote-notification</string>\n</array>\n```",

        "## Sample Notification Payload",
        "You can send a test push from Postman or backend:",
        "```json\n{\n  \"app_id\": \"YOUR-ONESIGNAL-APP-ID\",\n  \"include_player_ids\": [\"PLAYER_ID\"],\n  \"headings\": {\"en\": \"Update Available\"},\n  \"contents\": {\"en\": \"Check out the latest improvements!\"},\n  \"android_sound\": \"notify_sound\",\n  \"ios_sound\": \"notify_sound.wav\"\n}\n```",

        "## Images & UI Previews",
        "### OneSignal Dashboard",
        "![OneSignal Dashboard](https://onesignal.com/assets/images/landing-page/notification-dashboard.png)",
        "### Android Notification Preview",
        "![Android Notification](https://developer.android.com/images/ui/notifications/notification-icon.png)",

        "## Key Statistics About Notifications",
        "- 70% of users allow push notifications",
        "- Custom sounds can increase open rates by 3x",
        "- Most users check a push within 1 minute",

        "## Pro Tips",
        "- Use `OneSignal.shared.getDeviceState()` to get player ID and manage subscriptions",
        "- Bundle this logic into a `NotificationService` and reuse across apps",
        "- For testing, simulate foreground/background/terminated states during QA",

        "## Conclusion",
        "By integrating OneSignal into your Flutter app, you empower your app to re-engage users with personalized, timely notifications — complete with your own sound and branding. Set it up once, reuse it everywhere!"

        "Firebase Authentication is one of the easiest ways to add secure login and user management to your Flutter app. In this guide, we'll implement both email/password login and Google Sign-In using the official `firebase_auth` and `google_sign_in` packages.",

        "## Prerequisites",
        "- Flutter 3.0+",
        "- A Firebase project created at [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com)",
        "- FlutterFire CLI installed: `dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli`",

        "## Step 1: Create Firebase Project and Register App",
        "1. Go to Firebase Console",
        "2. Register Android and iOS apps",
        "3. Add `google-services.json` (Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS)",

        "## Step 2: Initialize Firebase",
        "Add dependencies in `pubspec.yaml`:",
        "```yaml\ndependencies:\n  firebase_core: ^2.24.2\n  firebase_auth: ^4.19.2\n  google_sign_in: ^6.2.1\n```",

        "Run:",
        "```bash\nflutter pub get\n```",

        "Initialize Firebase in `main.dart`:",
        "```dart\nvoid main() async {\n  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();\n  await Firebase.initializeApp();\n  runApp(MyApp());\n}\n```",

        "## Step 3: Email & Password Authentication",
        "Sign Up:",
        "```dart\nFuture<UserCredential> signUp(String email, String password) async {\n  return await FirebaseAuth.instance.createUserWithEmailAndPassword(\n    email: email,\n    password: password,\n  );\n}\n```",
        "Sign In:",
        "```dart\nFuture<UserCredential> signIn(String email, String password) async {\n  return await FirebaseAuth.instance.signInWithEmailAndPassword(\n    email: email,\n    password: password,\n  );\n}\n```",
        "Sign Out:",
        "```dart\nFuture<void> signOut() async {\n  await FirebaseAuth.instance.signOut();\n}\n```",

        "## Step 4: Google Sign-In Integration",
        "Firebase Console: Enable Google Sign-In under Authentication > Sign-in method",
        "Code:",
        "```dart\nFuture<UserCredential> signInWithGoogle() async {\n  final GoogleSignInAccount? googleUser = await GoogleSignIn().signIn();\n  final GoogleSignInAuthentication? googleAuth = await googleUser?.authentication;\n\n  final credential = GoogleAuthProvider.credential(\n    accessToken: googleAuth?.accessToken,\n    idToken: googleAuth?.idToken,\n  );\n\n  return await FirebaseAuth.instance.signInWithCredential(credential);\n}\n```",

        "## Step 5: Minimal UI",
        "```dart\nclass LoginScreen extends StatelessWidget {\n  final emailController = TextEditingController();\n  final passwordController = TextEditingController();\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return Scaffold(\n      body: Padding(\n        padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),\n        child: Column(\n          children: [\n            TextField(controller: emailController, decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Email')),\n            TextField(controller: passwordController, decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Password'), obscureText: true),\n            ElevatedButton(\n              onPressed: () => signIn(emailController.text, passwordController.text),\n              child: Text('Login'),\n            ),\n            ElevatedButton.icon(\n              onPressed: () => signInWithGoogle(),\n              icon: Icon(Icons.login),\n              label: Text(\"Login with Google\"),\n            ),\n          ],\n        ),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n```",

        "## Extra Tips",
        "- Use `FirebaseAuth.instance.authStateChanges()` to track login state",
        "- Handle `FirebaseAuthException` to catch errors like wrong password or user not found",
        "- Use `FirebaseAuth.instance.currentUser` to get the current user",

        "## Conclusion",
        "With Firebase Authentication, you can add secure login features to your Flutter app quickly. This approach scales well and supports advanced auth providers and role-based access if needed later."

        "# Google Play Removed 47% of Apps: Developer's Survival Guide",

        "In 2024, Google removed over 1.6 million apps from the Play Store due to privacy violations, outdated SDKs, and policy non-compliance. If you're a developer, this guide shows what went wrong—and how to make sure your app isn't next.",

        "## Why Were So Many Apps Removed?",

        "- **Privacy issues**: Apps were requesting sensitive permissions they didn’t need.\n- **Background misuse**: Apps kept running in the background, draining battery.\n- **Outdated SDKs**: Some apps were built on old Android versions, lacking modern security patches.\n- **Inactive apps**: Many apps hadn’t been updated in over 2 years.\n- **Policy violations**: Especially around data collection and deceptive behavior.",

        "## Common Mistakes (and How to Fix Them)",

        "### 1. Requesting Permissions Too Early",

        "**🚫 Don't do this (Android):**",
        "```kotlin\nrequestPermissions(arrayOf(\n  Manifest.permission.CAMERA,\n  Manifest.permission.READ_CONTACTS\n), 100)\n```",

        "**✅ Do this instead:** Ask only when needed and explain why.",
        "```kotlin\nif (shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale(Manifest.permission.CAMERA)) {\n    // Show a dialog to explain why\n}\nrequestPermissions(arrayOf(Manifest.permission.CAMERA), 100)\n```",

        "**✅ In Flutter:** Use [permission_handler](https://pub.dev/packages/permission_handler)",
        "```dart\nvar status = await Permission.camera.status;\nif (!status.isGranted) {\n  await Permission.camera.request();\n}\n```",

        "### 2. Running Background Tasks Forever",

        "**🚫 Don't do this:**",
        "```kotlin\nThread {\n  while (true) {\n    Thread.sleep(60000)\n    // Do something\n  }\n}.start()\n```",

        "**✅ Do this (Android): Use WorkManager for background tasks**",
        "```kotlin\nval work = PeriodicWorkRequestBuilder<MyWorker>(15, TimeUnit.MINUTES).build()\nWorkManager.getInstance(context).enqueue(work)\n```",

        "**✅ In Flutter:** Use [workmanager](https://pub.dev/packages/workmanager)",
        "```dart\nWorkmanager().initialize(callbackDispatcher);\nWorkmanager().registerPeriodicTask(\n  'task-identifier',\n  'simpleTask',\n  frequency: Duration(hours: 1),\n);\n```",

        "### 3. Collecting Too Much Personal Data",

        "**🚫 Don't hardcode or over-collect user data:**",
        "```kotlin\nval data = mapOf(\"email\" to user.email, \"phone\" to user.phone)\n```",

        "**✅ Do this instead: collect minimal, anonymized data**",
        "```kotlin\nval data = mapOf(\"user_type\" to \"seller\", \"usage\" to \"daily\")\n```",

        "**✅ In Flutter (for analytics):**",
        "```dart\nFirebaseAnalytics.instance.logEvent(\n  name: 'app_usage',\n  parameters: {'role': 'buyer'},\n);\n```",

        "## 📋 Quick Developer Checklist (2025 Edition)",

        "- [ ] Only request permissions when absolutely necessary.\n- [ ] Use WorkManager or equivalent for background work.\n- [ ] Avoid collecting PII unless required.\n- [ ] Keep your `targetSdkVersion` up-to-date.\n- [ ] Provide a clear privacy policy in the Play Console.\n- [ ] Use HTTPS and secure data transmission.\n- [ ] Avoid using deprecated APIs or libraries.\n- [ ] Remove unused code or packages (especially SDKs).",

        "## 🧠 What This Means for Developers",

        "- There's **less noise** in the store—so quality apps stand out more.\n- If you keep your app clean, private, and performant, you’ll have a better shot at ranking higher.\n- Google is rewarding good behavior: stability, security, and transparency are now competitive advantages.",

        "## 🔚 Final Thoughts",

        "The Play Store is evolving. Survival now means writing clean code, using modern SDKs, and respecting user privacy. This isn’t just about compliance—it’s about building better apps that users trust and enjoy using."
